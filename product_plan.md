# MASH APP
### Product Plan
Build the childhood game MASH!

### Developer Version
- HEADERS - company type, languages, perks, and salary
User inputs 4 of each into a form and then rolls a die (or draw a spiral - brownie points). The count determines how many times you go around before crossing off that element. Continue until 1 element left in each category. Final screen will distinguish which element was chosen.

### Regular Version
- HEADERS - crushes, cars, kids + MASH
Same functionality.

### Concepts/Technologies to Incorportate
- Instagram OAuth
- User entry into forms
- persisting user data across activities
- animations (to count and cross off elements)
- exporting final page to Instagram (using a screenshot?)
